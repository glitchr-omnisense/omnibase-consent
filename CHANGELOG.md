# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-11-14

### Changed

- Accepts omnisense/omnibase 6.0: `omnisense/omnibase` ^5.1 || ^6.0, `omnibridge/symfony` ^1.1 || ^2.0 (require-dev, and in the suggestion). The
  same code runs on both lines: it names no former name and no entry point 6.0 removed.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-14

### Changed

- The classes omnisense/omnibase 5.0 moved to omnibridge/symfony named by their new names:
  `Omnibridge\Symfony\Omnibase\Bundle\{AbstractBaseBundle, AbstractBaseExtension, AbstractBaseConfiguration}`
  in place of `Base\Bundle\*`, former names the core keeps only as aliases until 6.0. No behaviour change.
- ConsentExtension (Twig) is handed the `advanced_router` service, which `Base\Routing\AdvancedRouterInterface`
  was an alias of: the same router. ConsentExtensionTest stubs
  `Omnibridge\Symfony\Omnibase\Routing\AdvancedRouterInterface`; BareTest expects omnibridge/symfony's
  AbstractBaseBundle as the bundle's parent.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-13

First stable release.

### Changed

- Installs with the default minimum-stability: stable requirements (`omnisense/omnibase` ^5.1), a branch alias,
  no `minimum-stability: dev` left to the sites.
- CI: glitchr-studio/ci's package workflow (the bundle installed alone, composer validate, PHPUnit,
  PHPStan against its baseline, a consumer install without require-dev) and its release workflow.
- require-dev: PHPUnit and omnibridge/symfony (the Symfony bridge's tests and PHPStan);
  a data provider declared as an attribute for PHPUnit 12.
